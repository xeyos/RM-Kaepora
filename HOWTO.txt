To compile this code you will need:
 -QT v5.2 or higher (i usually handle the project with QTCreator 3) 

In addition you will need to compile and add the next libraries:
 -For Linux:
	-Install postgreSQL from repository (postgresql and postgresql-contrib)
	-Install instal libpqxx from repository (libpqxx-dev)
	-Install Alsa from repository (libasound2-dev)
	-Compile Google Protocol Buffers and set:
		-libprotobuf.a at RM-Kaepora/Network/Proto
		-The headers at RM-Kaepora/Network/Proto/google/protobuf , respecting its folder structure.
Finally you can find at Kaepora/DB a file named KaeporaDB wich is an empty database backup generated with pgadmin3 so you dont need to recreate the entire DB structure.

With this you should be able to compile and execute the software, please, share your thoughts!

NOTE: At the settings window (first use) the last field (server name) is the server location (ip or domain, whatever you use) so he can recognice himself.
